   # Edit .env with your CharmHealth API credentials
   ```

3. **Run the server**:
   ```bash
   uv run --directory src mcp_server.py
   ```

4. **Configure your HIPAA-compliant MCP client** (e.g., an enterprise/HIPAA-compliant deployment of your chosen client) to connect to the server.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.13 or higher
- CharmHealth API credentials (sandbox or production)
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) to run the server
- An MCP client that is HIPAA-compliant or operated under your HIPAA program
- An LLM service that is HIPAA-compliant and covered by a signed BAA


## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CharmHealth/charm-mcp-server.git
cd charm-mcp-server
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Using uv (recommended):
```bash
uv sync
```

**Note**: This project uses `pyproject.toml` for dependency management. If you prefer pip, you can install from the project definition:
```bash
pip install -e .
```

### 3. Environment Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the project root with your CharmHealth API credentials:

```env
# CharmHealth API Configuration
CHARMHEALTH_BASE_URL=your_base_uri_here
CHARMHEALTH_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
CHARMHEALTH_REFRESH_TOKEN=your_refresh_token_here
CHARMHEALTH_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id_here
CHARMHEALTH_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret_here
CHARMHEALTH_REDIRECT_URI=your_redirect_uri_here
CHARMHEALTH_TOKEN_URL=your_token_url_here

# Optional: Set to "prod" for production logging
ENV=dev

# Enable or disable metric collection using OTEL. This is disabled by default. 
COLLECT_METRICS=false
```

**Important**: All environment variables must be properly set before running the server. The server will fail to start if required CharmHealth API credentials are missing.

### 4. Obtain CharmHealth API Credentials

To get your CharmHealth API credentials:

1. **Contact CharmHealth**: Reach out to CharmHealth API support to request API access
2. **OAuth Setup**: Follow their OAuth 2.0 setup process to obtain:
   - API Key
   - Client ID
   - Client Secret  
   - Refresh Token
   - Redirect URI
3. **Sandbox vs Production**: Use sandbox URLs for testing, production URLs for live data

## Running the Server


```bash
# Stdio mode (default)
uv run --directory src mcp_server.py

# HTTP mode
uv run --directory src mcp_server.py http
```

## Docker Deployment

The MCP server can be run as a Docker container for easier deployment and isolation.

### Running with Docker

#### Stdio Transport Mode (Default)

Run the container with stdio transport for MCP client connections:

```bash
docker run --rm -i \
  -e CHARMHEALTH_BASE_URL='https://sandbox3.charmtracker.com/api/ehr/v1' \
  -e CHARMHEALTH_API_KEY='your_api_key_here' \
  -e CHARMHEALTH_REFRESH_TOKEN='your_refresh_token_here' \
  -e CHARMHEALTH_CLIENT_ID='your_client_id_here' \
  -e CHARMHEALTH_CLIENT_SECRET='your_client_secret_here' \
  -e CHARMHEALTH_REDIRECT_URI='your_redirect_uri_here' \
  -e CHARMHEALTH_TOKEN_URL='your_token_url_here' \
  charm-mcp-server
```

#### HTTP Transport Mode

For HTTP mode, expose the port and modify the server configuration:

```bash
docker run --rm -i \
  -e CHARMHEALTH_BASE_URL='https://sandbox3.charmtracker.com/api/ehr/v1' \
  -e CHARMHEALTH_API_KEY='your_api_key_here' \
  -e CHARMHEALTH_REFRESH_TOKEN='your_refresh_token_here' \
  -e CHARMHEALTH_CLIENT_ID='your_client_id_here' \
  -e CHARMHEALTH_CLIENT_SECRET='your_client_secret_here' \
  -e CHARMHEALTH_REDIRECT_URI='your_redirect_uri_here' \
  -e CHARMHEALTH_TOKEN_URL='your_token_url_here' \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  charm-mcp-server
```

**Note**: For HTTP mode, you'll need to modify `mcp_server.py` to use HTTP transport:
```python
mcp_composite_server.run(transport="http", host="0.0.0.0", port=8080)
```

### MCP Client Configuration with Docker

#### Stdio Transport Mode

Configure your MCP client to use the Docker container:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "charm-mcp-server-docker": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "--rm",
        "-i",
        "-e",
        "CHARMHEALTH_BASE_URL=https://sandbox3.charmtracker.com/api/ehr/v1",
        "-e",
        "CHARMHEALTH_API_KEY=your_api_key_here",
        "-e",
        "CHARMHEALTH_REFRESH_TOKEN=your_refresh_token_here",

        "charm-mcp-server"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

#### HTTP Transport Mode

For clients that support HTTP transport:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "charm-health-http": {
      "url": "http://localhost:8080/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

### Docker Compose

## MCP Client Configuration

### MCP Clients with local LLMs (e.g., LM Studio)

Use a local/on-device LLM-based MCP client to keep PHI within your environment. Configure your client to launch this server via stdio.

Example (for clients that accept a JSON-based configuration schema):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "charm-mcp-server": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": [
                "--directory",
                "/path/to/charm-mcp-server/src",
                "run",
                "mcp_server.py"
                ],
      "env": {
        "CHARMHEALTH_BASE_URL": "https://sandbox3.charmtracker.com/api/ehr/v1",
        "CHARMHEALTH_API_KEY": "your_api_key_here",
        "CHARMHEALTH_REFRESH_TOKEN": "your_refresh_token_here",
        "CHARMHEALTH_CLIENT_ID": "your_client_id_here",
        "CHARMHEALTH_CLIENT_SECRET": "your_client_secret_here",
        "CHARMHEALTH_REDIRECT_URI": "your_redirect_uri_here",
        "CHARMHEALTH_TOKEN_URL": "your_token_url_here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Note: Do not use non-HIPAA consumer clients (e.g., Claude Desktop) with PHI.

### Other MCP Clients

For other MCP clients, configure them to run the server using:
- **Command**: `uv run src/mcp_server.py` (from project root) or `python mcp_server.py` (from src/ directory)
- **Transport**: stdio
- **Environment**: Include all CharmHealth API credentials

## HIPAA and PHI Compliance

When handling PHI, you must ensure your entire toolchain is HIPAA compliant:

- Only use HIPAA-compliant LLMs under a signed BAA. Configure zero data retention and disable model training.
- Only use HIPAA-compliant MCP clients, or run clients within a controlled environment covered by your HIPAA program. Validate any third-party extensions or tools used by the client.
- Enforce least-privilege access controls, audit logging, and encryption in transit and at rest.
- Avoid sending PHI to logs or telemetry. Keep `COLLECT_METRICS=false` unless your telemetry backend is HIPAA-compliant and covered by a BAA.
- Review and adhere to your organization’s HIPAA policies for data handling, retention, and breach notification.
